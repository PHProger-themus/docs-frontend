# Boguchar Docs

Docs website. I read a lot of stuff in my free time and I need to write down the information somewhere to be able to restore it when needed without reading giant articles and watching hours long videos. The website will be working soon, and I will provide link here.

The website will have two sections at the start.

## Reading list

Reading list from old website (rb-stuff). Just a table with all the books I've read and comments.

## Docs

I've started with Notion, but then decided to move on to Obsidian. But Obsidian is local (sync is paid option). So I've decided to sync my contents with GitHub and after this - to publish it on my website, but in private access. I will create accounts for all trusted people myself for them to be able to read contents.
